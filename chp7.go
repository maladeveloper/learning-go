/**
1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a method and a function?
A method is a function that belongs to a struct. In Go terms, 
a method has a receiver whilst a function does not.

2. Why would you use an embedded anonymous field instead of a normal named
field?
Would be used for 'is a' relationships such that the methods of the embedded type
may be called directly from the struct containing it.

3. Add a new perimeter method to the Shape interface to calculate the perimeter of
a shape. Implement the method for Circle and Rectangle.
